# Security Practices and Guidelines

- **Version Control:** Use Git with signed commits and pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and avoid accidental exposure of sensitive files (e.g., .env).
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Consider using libraries such as Joi for schema validation.
- **Data Protection:** Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, and additional sensitive data is encrypted using Nodeâ€™s crypto module.
- **Static Analysis:** ESLint with the security plugin is used to catch vulnerabilities early.
- **Code Reviews:** All code changes must be reviewed for security issues before merging.
- **Backup:** Regular backups are scheduled and documented.
